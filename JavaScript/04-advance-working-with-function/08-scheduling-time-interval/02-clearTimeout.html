    <script>
      // canceling with clearTimeout
      let timerId = setTimeout(() => alert("never happens"), 1000);
      alert(timerId); // timer identifier

      clearTimeout(timerId);
      alert(timerId); // same identifier (doesn't become null after canceling)
    </script>

    <p>
      As we can see from alert output, in a browser the timer identifier is a
      number. In other environments, this can be something else. For instance,
      Node.js returns a timer object with additional methods. Again, there is no
      universal specification for these methods, so thatâ€™s fine. For browsers,
      timers are described in the timers section of HTML5 standard.
