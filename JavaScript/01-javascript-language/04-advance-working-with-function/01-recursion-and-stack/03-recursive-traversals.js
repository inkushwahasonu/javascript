// recursive traversals
// another great application of recursion is recursive traversal

/***
 * As we can see, when our function gets a department to sum, there are two possible cases:

Either it’s a “simple” department with an array of people – then we can sum the salaries in a simple loop.
Or it’s an object with N subdepartments – then we can make N recursive calls to get the sum for each of the subdeps and combine the results.
The 1st case is the base of recursion, the trivial case, when we get an array.

The 2nd case when we get an object is the recursive step. A complex task is split into subtasks for smaller departments. They may in turn split again, but sooner or later the split will finish at (1).

//The algorithm is probably even easier to read from the code:

let company = {
  // the same object, compressed for brevity
  sales: [
    { name: "John", salary: 1000 },
    { name: "Alica", salary: 1600 },
  ],
  development: {
    sites: [
      { name: "Peter", salary: 2000 },
      { name: "Alex", salary: 1800 },
    ],
    internals: [{ name: "Jack", salary: 1300 }],
  },
};

// the function to do job

function sumSalaries(department) {
  if (Array.isArray(department)) {
    // case (1)
    return department.reduce((prev, current) => prev + current.salary, 0); // sum the array
  } else {
    // case (2)
    let sum = 0;
    for (let subdep of Object.values(department)) {
      sum += sumSalaries(subdep); //  // recursively call for subdepartments, sum of the results
    }
    return sum;
  }
}
console.log(sumSalaries(company)); // 7700
