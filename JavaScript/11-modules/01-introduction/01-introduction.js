//  MODULES INTRODUCTION
// As our application grows bigger, we want to split it into multiple files, so called “modules”. A module may contain a class or a library of functions for a specific purpose.


/*
To name some (for historical reasons):

AMD – one of the most ancient module systems, initially implemented by the library require.js.
CommonJS – the module system created for Node.js server.
UMD – one more module system, suggested as a universal one, compatible with AMD and CommonJS.
*/



// A module is just a file. One script is one module. As simple as that.

/*
- export keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module.
- import allows the import of functionality from other modules.
